# next steps
- simple 'ghosts', randomly spawning and moving down the track, no effect

## initial release goals (no stretch)
- speed increase with time/score increase
- add scoring
- add ghosts (try and use ghost unicode char) - just obstacles for now
- add YomYom flash for 100pts
- add powerpill horrendous strobe for eating ghosts

## future possibilites/stretch
- add simple procedural maze generation at higher difficulties (blocks movement, pushes character back in x)
- moving ghosts

## DONE
- add playgrid horizontal margin with cycling 2 colour oscillation to give sense of movement - *DONE*
